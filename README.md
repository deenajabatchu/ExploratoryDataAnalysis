# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” Layoffs Dataset (SQL)

This project continues from my previous **[Data Cleaning Project](https://github.com/deenajabatchu/DataCleaning)**, where the raw layoffs dataset (`layoffs.csv`) was cleaned, standardized, and prepared for analysis using SQL.  

This section focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL, performed on the cleaned `layoffs_staging2` dataset from the **Data Cleaning project**.  

After cleaning and preparing the data, the goal of EDA is to:
- Understand trends and patterns in layoffs  
- Identify which companies, industries, and time periods were most affected  
- Perform aggregations, rankings, and time-based analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The EDA aims to answer key business questions such as:
- Which companies had the highest layoffs?  
- Which industries were most affected?  
- How did layoffs trend over time?  
- Which years or months experienced the largest layoffs?  
- Who were the top 5 companies with maximum layoffs each year?
